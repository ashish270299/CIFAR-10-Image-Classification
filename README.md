The dataset which is CIFAR 10 is a subset of 80 million tiny images dataset, all the attributes or data is in the form of an array of RGB values of the given 60000 images which have the image size of 32x32. This data has various classes such as Airplane, Truck, Frogs, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Horse, Ship. 

Need to classify these classes using the image recognition techniques and using various models which can help achieve the target and correctly classify the images among various classes. This data is a standard dataset which is often used in computer vision and deep learning.

The motivation behind working on this dataset is to deep dive into the image classification techniques and be able to differentiate between the images through various machine learning or deep learning models. This data will help achieve the ability to explore the image data and to classify images with the help of deep learning and using the neural networks.
